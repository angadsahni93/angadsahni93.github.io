#### Strategy
During the [Reading Scholars Summer Residential](https://angadsahni93.github.io/outreach.html#--5th-7th-july-2022-summer-residential), me and my MSc student (Tarun Vermani) gave talks. Tarun spoke about the ESM study to the adolescent cohort after the poster presentations and encouraged them sign-up. He humanised the research, in that he stressed that the research will help to deal with the uniquely adolescent anxieties that they suffer from. I was very fortunate to have him on-board because this is a skill that I lack. For my part, I stressed the fact that this will reflect well on their personal statements, as they will be applying for universities from September '22. These efforts lead to **around 12** sign-ups as I asked those interested should give me their email addresses.

I used the same strategy in the [Bulmershe School's talk](https://angadsahni93.github.io/outreach.html#bulmershe-school). I further discussed, as I had previously done in the [St. Joseph's College talk](https://angadsahni93.github.io/outreach.html#st-josephs-college), that I would like to develop a [Youth Advisory Group](https://angadsahni93.github.io/yga.html), involvement in which would also look good on their personal statements. More details given on the page.
