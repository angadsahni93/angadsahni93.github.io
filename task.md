## Design
#### Maximizing Reward & Minimizing Effort
A probabilistic task containing both effort and reward elements had been developed by [Skvortsova et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1350-14.2014).

##### Figure 1:

<br>
<br>

The task layout included a reward element associated with required effort (Outcome, Fig. 1). The 'effort' stage, once completed, leads to 'payoff' of the reward.
<br>

The team divided the reward and effort elements into **high** and **low** magnitudes. 10 and 20cents were used as monetary reward, while the effort calibrations required more work. The task invovled physical effort, measured by the force with which participants squeezed a tube with each hand. Initially, participants would exert maximum effort 4 times, where 100% effort was an average of the 4. Then, the **20%** and **80%** of max were defined as the low and high effort paradigms, respectively.

<br>


The probabilistic learning element was then introduced at the 'choice' stage of the task. Participants were to choose one of two shapes, each probabilistically associated with the **better** option of either the reward or effort element. <br>

For example, both shapes may lead to the **high effort** but only left one leads to **high reward** (the better outcome); the team called this the **'reward learning'** paradigm. 
<!-- Explain what reward learning means. If it were a block design, the participant would figure out that only the rewards change, not the effort. Therefore, the strategy the design involves trying to achieve the high reward; reward is given **salience**. -->
