## Design
#### Background
A probabilistic task containing both effort and reward elements had been developed by [Skvortsova et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1350-14.2014).
<br>

##### Figure 1: The layout of the task designed by Skvortsova et al., taken from Fig. 1A of their paper.

<br>
<br>

The task layout included a reward element associated with required effort (Outcome, Fig. 1). The 'effort' stage, once completed, leads to 'payoff' of the reward.
<br>

The team divided the reward and effort elements into **high** and **low** magnitudes. 10 and 20cents were used as monetary reward, while the effort calibrations required more work. The task involved physical effort, measured by the force with which participants squeezed a tube with each hand. Initially, participants would exert maximum effort 4 times, where 100% effort was an average of the 4. Then, the **20%** and **80%** of max were defined as the low and high effort paradigms, respectively.

<br>


The probabilistic learning element was then introduced at the 'choice' stage of the task. Participants were to choose one of two shapes, each probabilistically associated with the **better** option of either the reward or effort element. <br>

For example, both shapes may lead to the **high effort** but only the **left** one leads to **high reward** (the **better outcome**); the team called this the **'reward learning'** paradigm. 

<!-- Explain what reward learning means. If it were a block design, the participant would figure out that only the rewards change, not the effort. Therefore, the strategy the design involves trying to achieve the high reward; reward is given **salience**. -->

## Recruitment
#### Strategy
Initially, the strategy involved going to schools, giving talks (as discussed in [Outreach](outreach.md#contents)) and getting data for the task in exchange.
<br>
<br>
But as the summer holidays (2022) have come around, online recruitment is all that is available. For this, I have created an online page ([TASK_Study](https://nrg-hub.github.io/TASK_Study/)) that **briefly** discusses the task, giving the instructions contained within the task already. I ensured I gave the same instructions in my talks too.
